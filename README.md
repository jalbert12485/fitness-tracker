## About 
 In this project we provide a intuitional user inerface that allows the user to keep track of their workout.  They can add exercises to their current workout and the total work they've done will be displayed.  If they leave and want to start a new workout, they are then able to create a new workout which they can again add exercises to.

## Usage 
 In order to use this project as a user, you will go to the [deployed project](https://morning-tor-96328.herokuapp.com/?id=5fae161b53fea50017749a3e).  When there, you will prompted for what actions you would like to take.  If the program has not been used before, you will only be able to add a workout.  Otherwise, you can continue your last workout or add a new one.  After deciding which of these you would like to do, you can then add a cardio or restistance exercise.  Once you fill in the required inputs, you can either continue your workout and add another exercise, or you can complete the workout.  When the workout is completed you will be brought back to the starting page and your totals will be displayed to you.
